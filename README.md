# Which is the hottest city in fashion right now?

Whether you like it hot or cool, this app will tell you where to find the best temperatures in the best cities with the hottest (or coolest) outfits.

## Features

*   Simple UI
*   Responsive - Built mobile first
*   Weather data gathered from YQL showing the current temperature for the top fashion cities of the world
*   Built using RequireJS, AMD modules, Backbone, GSAP for UI and animation, and a sprinkling of CSS3

## Future additions:

*   Tweets for #ootd or #fashion - based on city geo coordinates could be added to each city view - possibly showing pictures
*   App could suggest clothing for the type of weather you are seeing at each city - with link to buy products
*   Forecast/current view - switch between views to see what the weather will be like for the coming week
*   Show flight costs to the city
